# inferring-causal-priors

This is a repo for (preliminary) work examining how mechanistic understandings or explanations might shape people's priors about causal relationships. The idea is to use webppl to combine bayesian cognitive modeling and bayesian data analysis to infer causal learner's domain-specific priors based on their responses in a causal learning task.

###  Some notes ...

Requires a `jStat` package (v 1.7 or above). From inside project folder, install with `npm install jStat`. Also requires the webppl package  `discretizedBeta` included in the repo.
