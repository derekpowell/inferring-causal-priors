# inferring-causal-priors

This is a repo for (preliminary) work examining how mechanistic understandings or explanations might shape people's priors about causal relationships. The idea is to use webppl to combine bayesian cognitive modeling and bayesian data analysis to infer causal learner's domain-specific priors based on their responses in a causal learning task.

###  Some notes ...

Requires a `jStat` package be installed into a `node_modules` folder. Also requires a webppl package in there with `discretizedBeta()` function. 


Some stray thoughts ...

Might also consider using a "binned histogram" task to elicit priors, and/or compare the results of the two methods
